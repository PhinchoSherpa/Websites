      <p>She rejected the ceremonial tradition of the First Lady and embraced a more political role by being an active participant in her husband’s administration. She used her platform for social activism and spoke out in support of civil rights and women’s rights. She instituted regular White House press conferences for women correspondents, and wire services that had not formerly employed women. In just her first year as First Lady, she traveled over 40,000 miles. Over the course of her life, she visited every continent except Antarctica, and all 48 of the (then) United States. She visited royal palaces and housing projects, spoke to world leaders and student groups and gave speeches, press conferences, and interviews. She was an early champion of civil rights for african americans, as well as an advocate for women, american workers, the poor and young people. She believed that  it was her responsibility to see all people everywhere lived with dignity and hope.

      <p>After her husband’s death in 1945, and until 1951, Eleanor became the first representative of the United Nations and an advocate for its Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted by the UN General Assembly, was the result of the experience of WWII. The UHDR became the model for the constitutions of nations emerging from colonialism in the postwar period and the standard for rights throughout the world. Eleanor Roosevelt played an instrumental role in the drafting of this historic document. It was made up of 18 members from various political, cultural and religious backgrounds. She held the whole effort together when everyone brought their perspective.

      <p>When the world was in chaos Roosevelt made it easier for refugees to enter the U.S. from Germany. She worked with organizations like Emergency Rescue Committee for the Care of European Children, and the Children’s Crusade for Children. While the laws still remained the same, she was able to help in individual cases but she wasn’t able to achieve all that she wanted because of  the restrictive visa policies of Breckinridge Long. Instead, she persuaded   citizens to take on volunteer work and tried to make their as useful as possible. </p>
